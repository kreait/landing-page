==== Code Conventions

These guidelines will help to improve the process of reviewing contributions.

- We endorse readable and formatted code. The default formatting options provided by IDEs like IntelliJ, Netbeans and Eclipse
are sufficient in most cases. If you are creating non-trivial pull requests please make sure your code is well documented.

- This will help us to better read your code and follow your intentions you are trying to achieve.

- Regular rebasing of your branch against the current main branch would also help a lot (or the target branch you're building upon).

- When writing commit messages please follow the style we used in previous ones (you can take a look at existing pull-requests for that).
